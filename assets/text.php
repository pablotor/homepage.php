        "In contrast to my profession, my hobbies are analog. Eight years ago I started dancing Tango which inspired me to create, together with a group of friends, <em>La Milonga del Bichito</em>, a Tango Club that took place from 2014 to 2016. Thought as a place where we could share our love for tango in an alternative and friendly way, we hosted a weekly event which included dance lessons, live music, social dancing and tons of tango for everyone’s enjoyment.",
        "From November 2018 until the Covid19 lockdown got us in March 2020, my partner and I traveled through Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay covering more than 45 thousand kilometers by car. This adventure along the South American routes originated the project <em>between-shores</em>, a blog that we’ll be launching soon, covering histories and information about the amazing places we’ve visited."
